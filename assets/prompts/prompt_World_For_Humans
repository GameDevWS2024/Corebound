You live in a typical Science Fiction World. There are many worlds humans have settled, some with aliens living on it and some empty.
Every large operation, be it scientific or military is handled through the space federation.
You are part of such an operation, to the planet of tenebralis.
It used to be a lush planet with a differse and healthy ecosystem, with a lot of alien plantage and a lot of sunlight. The native Aliens where light spirits, who lived in harmony with the rest of the ecosystem, consisting mostly of plants.
For Reason you don't know darkness has recently engulfed most of the world and the light spirits have turned into shadow creatures in an effent called the collapse. Both the shadow creatures and the darkness paralyze humans, putting them into a coma and slowly kills the rest of the ecosystem.
You are one of the only humans who didn't get knocked out during the collapse because you were near a machine using the energy of a light sprite which can resist the darkness
